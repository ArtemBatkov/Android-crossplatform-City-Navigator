# <p align="center">Sight Navigator</p>
## &emsp;**Description** 
#### &emsp;City Navigator app is a product that can help people to find some sights in the exact city, select them and add them to their favorite list.  

<br>

## &emsp;**Technologies**
#### &emsp;The app is focused on cross-platform development. To build it, .NET MAUI was selected as for designing tool. The framework allows you to create a code once and then apply it to many OS like Windows, Android, iOS, and Mac. 

<br>

## &emsp;**Challanges**
#### &emsp;The project uses an open-source API called OpenTripMap API that was selected as an engine for sights searching. The API works unstable, it has many unstructured data while parsing JSON, and it also has many time request restrictions, but it is a free API. Overall, it is not the best choice to apply such API to this idea.
The second API is used here Google Places API, and it is used for fetching some images of cities that were added to the favorite list.

## &emsp;**Conclusion** 
#### 
 
  &emsp;The app showcases my proficiency in coding and architectural design, highlighting my ability to make informed decisions when selecting and researching API documentation. Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in handling service restrictions and further deepened my understanding of Dependency Injection.
  
  
  &emsp;While the app is a testament to my skills, it's important to note that users may encounter certain inconveniences. Specifically, the current version lacks font size adaptation functionality, making it less optimal for non-standard font sizes. We recognize the significance of font size adaptability and its impact on the overall user experience. As we move forward, we are committed to prioritizing the implementation of font size adaptation techniques in our future projects. This will ensure optimal readability across different devices and font settings, enhancing the overall user satisfaction.
  
  &emsp;Additionally, I intend to make the app open source and potentially publish it on the Play Market in the future. By sharing the code with the developer community, I hope to contribute to the collective knowledge and foster collaboration among fellow developers.
  
  &emsp;In conclusion, this project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to hone my skills and uncover areas for improvement. By addressing the font size adaptability issue and exploring opportunities for further development, I aim to create even more user-friendly and robust applications in the future.
